Netflix

Questions

		do i need to do authentication
		do i need to write algo for recommendation
		focus on user activity data
		Recommendation engine
		how many people have Netflix? - 200 M users

Types of data

		video content
		Video static content - names of movies, description, thumbnails
		user metadata - user watched, last watched, likes
		activity logs - clicks, impressions, scrolls

Assumptions

		200M users 10k Videos
		half movies and half shows
		1hr avg 30GB/hr = 300TB data
		use blob storage like AWS S3 because it has a ceiling of 300TB

Video static Content
		titles, desc, cast lists, etc
		for this we can use RDBMS
		also can use Cache to popular shows etc to decrease latency

User Metadata
		200M *
		Postgres (run complex queries in backend so using it instead of NoSQL)
		use sharding for low latency
		indexing on user id


Public Endpoints

We can use CDN (Content Delivery Network) if we want to expand as users can be from all around the globe.
We can add CDN Populator that will populate the cache servers or edge serverrs of CDN before the user requesting them
- delivers content and other digital assets to users based on their geographic location.
