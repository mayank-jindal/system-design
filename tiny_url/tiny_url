Shortening URL

System Requirements

- should be able to create a short url from a given long url
- able to redirect to long url on calling short url
- short url should be small like ad.com/{7 characters}
- we should retain the short url
- planning on using a Relational Database

Entities

- URL table
id shortUrl longUrl

URL shortening logic

- Base62
it requires a number and it converts it to base62 code
we can generate a random number for any given long url and convert it to base62 to be used as short url
save the values in DB

-MD5 Hash
converts a string aka our long url to some encoded long value
need to fetch starting 7 chars
save the values in DB

DB logic

for both logic, chances of collision are present
-Base62
to check collision, INSERT IF NOT EXISTS (can be used only in RDBMS)
collision occurs, generate new random number
-MD5
to check collision, INSERT IF NOT EXISTS (can be used only in RDBMS)
collision occurs, add some random string to long URL and then convert to short (not a feasible approach)

FIX
use counter
since each count will be new, no need to check before adding short url to DB

Problems with counter
what if service goes down
or we need to scale up, how will new/multiple server get control of counter

the solution to this is an distributed and open-source service called zookeeper
it helps in implementing high levels of synchronisation and configuration maintenance

to further make service better and more consistent
add load balancer
add caching mechanism


Apis required
/shorten : longurl to short URL
/redirect : fetch longURL and redirect
